# Online Violence Against Women in Politics 


This is a joint [project](https://www.fordinstitute.pitt.edu/working-groups-0/online-violence-against-women-politics) of Ko√ß University Center for Computational Social Sciences and the University of Pittsburgh 
Ford Institute of Human Security. We first built deep learning models to detect various types of online abuse like offensive and hate speech. BERT-based transformers models were employed to detect hate 
and offensive speech in tweets directed at male and female
Turkish candidates during the run-up to the 2023 general elections. Our models classified social media posts mentioning political figures into narrative categories, identifying whether the post discussed the individual's political or professional qualities (e.g., policy proposals, ideologies, or political performance) or personal traits (e.g., identity or personality).
