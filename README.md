# Online Violence Against Women in Politics 


This is a joint [project](https://www.fordinstitute.pitt.edu/working-groups-0/online-violence-against-women-politics) of Ko√ß University Center for Computational Social Sciences and the University of Pittsburgh 
Ford Institute of Human Security. Our objective was to develop and refine deep learning models capable of detecting and classifying instances of hate speech directed at political figures in social media posts during the run-up to the 2023 general elections. By analyzing a dataset of over 1.1 million tweets by approximately 176,000 users, the research dissects the temporality, spatial distribution, thematic content, and demographic characteristics of the hate speech, alongside its implications for candidates' electability.
